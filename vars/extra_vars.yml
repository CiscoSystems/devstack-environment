# Network related configuration
#
NET:
    pub_eth_interface:          "ansible_eth1"  # The interface on which the individual hosts
                                                # can reach each other. If we configure static
                                                # addresses in Vagrant, they will be on 'eth1'.
                                                # For lookup in the Ansible 'facts' dictionary,
                                                # we need to use the Ansible name of those
                                                # interfaces: "ansible_eth0", "ansible_eth1", etc.

#
# Cache related configuration
#
# We support the use of a PIP and APT caches. Currently, both need to be located on the
# same machine. If pkg_cache is set to "create" then a new cache installation is
# performed. If you already have a chache available, you can just specify "use" and
# the IP address of the cache machine.
#
# No harm is done if you leave the value at "create", Ansible will merely visit the
# cache machine to ensure that the config of the caches is as desired. However, it
# will save you a few seconds (maybe 20, depending on your environment?) if you set
# this to "use" after the cache machine has been fully built.
#
CACHE:
    pkg_cache:                  "create"        # "create" or "use" or "none"
    pkg_cache_existing_ip_addr: "192.168.99.99" # IP address of cache server. Ignored if "create" or "none".
    pip_cache_port:             3141

# The user that should install/run devstack.

USERS:
    stack_user:                 "vagrant"       # User will be created if necessary

#
# Details about the specific DevStack version and configuration you wish to run
#
# Note about the 'tunnel_type': Whatever is specified here will be used to find
# specific localrc files in the playbooks/templates directory. There should be
# a sub-directory in the template directory with the name that's specified here.
#
# So, in effect, the 'tunnel_type' is actually just a selector on your set of
# localrc files.

DEVSTACK:
    repo_version:               "master"
    repo_url:                   "git://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack.git"
    tunnel_type:                "gre"  # Look for directory of that name in template directory
    result_url:                 "http://<your base OpenStack controller host>/results"
