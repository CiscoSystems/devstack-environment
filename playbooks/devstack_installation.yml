# This playbook performs the necessary setup steps on an OpenStack guest in
# order to bring up devstack. It's assumed that all guests are in the 'cluster'
# group, with one of the guests also in the 'controller' group and the others
# in the 'compute' group.

# Basic system configuration: Ensure user and various system packages are
# present, configure the use of apt and pip caches.
